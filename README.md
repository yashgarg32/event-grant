The name of our project is "Decentralised Bitcoin Ecosystem Grant DAO".
The problem was that the growing Bitcoin Ecosystem lacks transparancy and theres no fair and open system for disributing funds.
Our proposed solution - we created a platform where fund is made up of contributions in STX and bitcoin from community members.
every transaction and vote is stored in the blockchain,its faster and more reliable and fair.
